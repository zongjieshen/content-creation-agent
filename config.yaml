    1. A detailed and engaging title (at least 10-15 words) that captures the essence of the content

    3. If you can confidently identify the location based on clear visual or metadata evidence, include it in the format "üìç {location}". If not certain, leave the location field empty.
    4. A list of relevant hashtags for social media
    5. Classify the video content into exactly ONE of these categories: "Fitness", "Food", "Travel", "Lifestyle", "Intro", "Parenting", or "Other". Choose the category that best represents the primary theme of the video.
    
    Format your response as structured data with:
    - title: the engaging title (string)
    - transcript: complete timestamped transcript with time markers [MM:SS] for your newly generated audio content (string)
    - location: string, optional, "üìç {location}" if certain, otherwise empty string
    - hashtags: list of hashtags, each with tag text and category (general, niche, trending, etc.)
    - category: exactly one category from the predefined list ("Fitness", "Food", "Travel", "Lifestyle", "Intro", "Parenting", "Other")
